## Description

[Disaster Resource Allocation API](https://disaster-app-c0gudrgjgtgncfgv.southeastasia-01.azurewebsites.net/api#/) API using **Nestjs**

## Problems

- to allocate emergency resource to affected area after natural disaster
- areas with higher emergency and tighter constrains receive resource first

## Requirement

- adding affected area
- adding resource trucks
- processes truck assignment by resource matching (area <> truck)
- return last processed assignment (cached by Redis)

### Require Logics

- resource matching (area <> truck)
- travel time constraint (area, area <> truck)
- priority by urgency
- redis caching
- assignment persistence (cached by redis for 30 minutes)

## Summary Problems

In summary, we have an **_affected area_** with require resources {eg.food,water} need to transfer within their **_time constraints_** and **_the truck_** that provided resources for. Matching them with resource and time constraints as **_an assignment_** results by **_higher urgency_** priority.

## What we gonna do ?

- How we created an input data ? (area,truck,resource) --> (json,dict format)
- How we matching between area, resource and truck by their constraints ? (area <> truck)
- How we caching a results ?
- How we documentation an API for client team and How we deploy an apps ?

## Project Design

how we design system --> Problem base driven design.<br />

1.  Platform design
2.  Database design
3.  Program design (Logics)

### 1. Platform design (Stacks)

**NestJS + Drizzle + Neon(_Serverless PostgreSQL_) + Redis** <br />

Why we use **NestJS** ?<br />

- **Typescript** support
- **Modular** architect
- **OOP** support
- Database integration (ORM support)
- Documentation (support **Swagger**)
- Auto reloading (built-in), we don't need **nodemon** anymore :D<br />

Why we selected **Drizzle** ?<br />

We can use as an ORM and Migration tools for database connection.<br />

- Typed SQL
- SQL Like
- Lightweight

Why we selected **Neon** ?<br />

- Free serverless PostgreSQL
- Easy for integrations
- Data type support (json)

### Summary tools for development

- Node.js Framework - **_NestJS_**
- Languages - **_Typescript_**
- Database integration - **_Drizzle_**
- Documentation - **_Swagger_**
- Caching - **_Redis by Keyv_**
- Testing - **_Postman_ , _DBeaver_**

### 2. Database design

1. **gathering requirements** - gather require from problems
2. **write nouns** - entities that need to be created
3. **design schema** - how we store a data in our storage

![design schema](./assets/images/disaster.png)

### 3. Program design (Logics)

We use a concept of modular and layered code, so we split a code into 2 group 4 module, 3 modules handle for business logics and 1 module stand for entities.

Business logics module

1. **area (disaster)** - handle for area input
2. **trucks** - handle for truck input
3. **assignment** - handle a process of an assignment including cached

Entities module

1. **database** - handle for all entities in our API
